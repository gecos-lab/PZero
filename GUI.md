# PZero Graphical User Interface

The main PZero application window is based on Qt (pyside6).

The graphics and actions are mostly designed using Designer

The main window includes 3 blocks:

  - TableView showing collections data

  - Visualization editor and logger (legend/properties)

  - An arbitrary number of Qt view windows (3d view, 2d view, plots, ...) with a graphical canvas and widgets listing all objects in the project and allowing configuration of their visual configuration.
